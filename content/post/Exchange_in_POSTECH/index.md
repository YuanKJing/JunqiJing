I am excited to share that I will soon begin a one-semester **exchange program** at **POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology)** in South Korea.

During my stay, I am honored to **join [MLVlab](https://sites.google.com/view/mlvlab/home)** and collaborate with **Professor [Kwang In Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/kimki)** on cutting-edge research.
