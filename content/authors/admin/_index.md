## About Me

My name is Junqi Jing (Chinese: 荆浚淇), and I am currently an undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology. I have previously visited the MiLab at Westlake University, where I had the opportunity to learn from Professor Donglin Wang. In July 2025, I will visit Professor Kai Zhang’s lab at Nanjing University. In the upcoming fall semester, I will join POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology), South Korea, as an exchange student and conduct research in the lab of Professor Kwang In Kim.
