        I‚Äôm Junqi Jing (ËçÜÊµöÊ∑á), a junior undergraduate in Software Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology. My research lies at the intersection of Embodied AI, Physical Simulation, and Multimodal Diffusion Models. 

        I have worked at Westlake University (MiLab), and will be an incoming exchange student at POSTECH under Prof. Kwang In Kim. I am a co-author of a paper accepted to ICLR 2025 (MTID) and involved in multiple ongoing projects related to physics-grounded LLMs and robotic learning from videos.

        Feel free to contact or collaborate!

        I'm interested in embodied intelligence, physics-informed AI, and generative modeling. I build systems that enable robots and agents to learn and reason in complex environments.

        My work spans from visual-language-based policy learning to dynamic 3D scene understanding using GNNs. Currently, I‚Äôm exploring how we can combine large language models, physical simulations, and diffusion policies to achieve generalizable decision-making.

        Always happy to collaborate or discuss ideas!
