      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

My name is Junqi Jing (Chinese: 荆浚淇), and I am currently an undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology. I have previously visited the MiLab at Westlake University, where I had the opportunity to learn from Professor Donglin Wang. In July 2025, I will visit Professor Kai Zhang’s lab at Nanjing University. In the upcoming fall semester, I will join POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology), South Korea, as an exchange student and conduct research in the lab of Professor Kwang In Kim.
