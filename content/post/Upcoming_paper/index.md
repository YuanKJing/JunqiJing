üöÄ **Exciting news! A new paper is about to be submitted to a top-tier conference!**

In this work, we propose an improved modeling framework for **heterogeneous hybrid objects**, based on advancements to the **Spring-Gaus** physics engine. The goal is to enable more accurate and physically consistent simulation of real-world object interactions in **embodied AI** scenarios.

In this article, I was responsible for constructing Unity-based physics simulation data, modifying the graph neural network (GNN) for the physics engine, conducting experimental validation, and contributing to the paper writing. Additionally, I participated in the creation of the first dataset for embodied physics simulation in the graph paradigm, which models learnable physical quantities for more realistic real-world object interactions.
