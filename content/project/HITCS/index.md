# HITCS Course Study Guide
**HITCS Course Study Guide** is an ongoing initiative by my friends and me to build an open, collaborative repository of learning materials for students in the Computer Science department at Harbin Institute of Technology.

So far, the total number of downloads has exceeded **10,000+**, and the site continues to receive growing attention. We have carefully organized resources for several core coursesâ€”including **lecture slides, experiment reports, course projects, and exam notes**â€”and published them as GitHub repositories for public access and contribution.

ðŸ”— Explore the full collection here: [GitHub â€“ YuanKJing](https://github.com/YuanKJing?tab=repositories)

We are continuously updating the materials and welcoming more students to participate in making this resource better.
