abstract: |
  We propose MTID, a novel diffusion-based model for procedure planning in instructional videosâ€”predicting coherent action sequences given the start and end observations. Unlike previous works that rely heavily on text-level supervision, MTID introduces a latent space temporal interpolation module to synthesize richer mid-state visual features, improving temporal reasoning. We further design an action-aware mask projection and a task-adaptive masked proximity loss, enabling the model to focus on task-relevant, temporally coherent actions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

summary: |
  MTID is a diffusion-based model for instructional video planning, incorporating latent temporal interpolation and task-aware masking for improved temporal reasoning.
