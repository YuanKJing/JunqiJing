**FleetEncounter**  
FleetEncounter was awarded the Best Project of the Year at Harbin Institute of Technology (Top 1% among all student projects), and was the only game development project among all recipients of the Excellence Award.

Inspired by the classic airplane battle genre, FleetEncounter introduces new gameplay modes such as local two-player combat and online multiplayer. The game supports cross-platform play on both PC and mobile devices.

Built with Unity, FleetEncounter integrates high-quality textures and dynamic effects to create an immersive and responsive experience for players.
